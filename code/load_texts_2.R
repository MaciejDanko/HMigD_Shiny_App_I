These models effectively integrate administrative and Labor Force Survey (LFS) data, addressing data quality challenges and variations in migration definitions.

  '<li><b>Data sources and quality assessment:</b> The app provides an overview of the input database (administrative data and LFS), including the results of data quality assessment used in the model. The data quality issues include: (1) Accuracy issues: Random errors in data collection can affect population and migration registers, as well as survey data. (2) Undercounting: Non-systematic bias in migration estimates due to registration failures and non-response in surveys. (3) Inconsistencies in coverage: Systematic biases resulting from rules in the data collection process that exclude certain population segments. (4) Inconsistent migration definitions: Varying international duration of stay criteria.</li>',
